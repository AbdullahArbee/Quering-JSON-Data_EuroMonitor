# Quering-JSON-Data_EuroMonitor
# Quering or Manipulating JSON-Data 
# For this program i used a simple Console Application however any application setting could have been used and made however one wished it to be
# First Create cs file for classes/Models
# Here we create classes and objects for our JSON data for better reusability etc.
# Next in our Program.cs file here we will bring in the JSON data itself and what i have done is stringified it already since its a small set of data
# We assign those tho variabe which we then use for deserializing into objects etc.
# we also download and use the nuget package newtonsoft.JSON which assists alot in the heavylifting of deserializing those json datasets etc.
# Next for the next few steps there are so many ways to achieve the outcomes we wanted for example, 
# We could use LINQ, or built in Math functions or just straight up for loops or foreach loops and work out the problems on our own.

# *Disclaimer* The methods used in this assignment however is not the best in terms of reusability and interms of cleanliness and simplicity.
# Notes have been used in certain places to give more clarity. Hope that is adequate.
